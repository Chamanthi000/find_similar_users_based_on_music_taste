Recommendation System

We present a recommendation system to recommend similar users and their songs to a target user. We believe by enhancing the social networking aspect, it will further reinforce usersâ€™ dependencies on music platforms and create more profits. Because it is difficult to measure the similar users we found for the target user explicitly, we conduct experiments on clustering to evaluate the validity of our pre-processing. The result demonstrates the effectiveness of scaling and averaging, and the authenticity of the similar users we recommended implicitly. Then we used the Surprise library to build a utility matrix and decompose it to recommend music and users such that the music is recommended only when the estimated listen count is above the mentioned threshold listen count.
